# javascript-beginner-quiz-app

Please see my javascript beginner quiz app in the following link:
https://repl.it/@wqx1331/Javascript-Beginner-Quiz-App

I also upload my quiz app code into this github file.

My javascript beginner quiz app includes 4 sections.
The first section is the start page. It will show the quiz description, javascript logo and start button.

When the user click the start button, the quiz app will render the quiz question and four options for user to make a choice.

The second section is the question page. THe user will see the question and four selected answers.

The third section is the feedback page. When the user select one option and the user will get feedback. When the user click the "next question" button, he or she will see the new question.

The fourth section is the score page. It will show the final score and "restart quiz" button.
